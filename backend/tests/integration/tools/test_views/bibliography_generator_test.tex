It's important to highlight the recent
work by Beacom, Bell, and Dodelson \cite{Beacom:2004yd}. I should also point out that
the papers \cite{hep-th/0501240,1979PhLB...80..360E} are being cited here in a
purely self-serving manner.  

I had better cite the most recent \cite{CERN-W5013}, since that
gets quite a lot of cites. You should really read \cite{CERN-W5013}.
Finally, let me make a mistake citing this paper \cite{Garcia:2020ay} which
doesn't exist in inspire.
