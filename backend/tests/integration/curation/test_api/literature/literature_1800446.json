The gray shaded regions show the expected $1\\sigma$, $2\\sigma$, and $3\\sigma$ fluctuations. For the orange and green curves, the data are compared with the distributions which marginalise over uncertainty in the power spectral density estimate. For the red and purple curves, the data are compared with the distributions which do not marginalize over uncertainty in the power spectral density estimate. We note that the latter pair of curves deviate from the $3\\sigma$ region, while the former does not. The data are well described by a stationary Gaussian process when marginalising over uncertainty in the power spectral density."
