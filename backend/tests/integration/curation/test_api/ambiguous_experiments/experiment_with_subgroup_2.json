  "description": "KEK B-factory is capable of producing more than a hundred million B meson pairs each year. When the facility becomes operational, the proposed experiment will study various aspects of B meson physics, including the long-standing puzzle of the violation of CP symmetry. The collaboration consists of physicists from fourteen countries and more than 60 institutions. The Letter of Intent has been accepted in March 94. Data taking began in FY 1998/99. For more information, please contact the Spokespersons.",
