  "description": "The SuperKEKB-Belle II experiment is a proposed upgrade of the currently running KEK B-Factory experiment, the pivotal experiment at KEK. The KEK B-Factory experiment has made great progress in exploring the mysteries of matter-antimatter asymmetry by colliding beams of high-energy electrons and positrons. About 100 accelerator experts and dozens of support staffs operate KEKB, while Belle attracts around 400 physicists from 60 institutes in 15 countries. The KEK B-Factory experiment employs a powerful double-ring collider, KEKB, which has produced about 800 million pairs of B anti-B mesons since beginning operation in 1999. The electron and positron beams accelerated to near the speed of light in the KEKB's 3-kilometer rings collide at the center of the Belle detector, and produce pairs of B and anti-B mesons. These mesons and anti-mesons decay, but B mesons do not have the same decay pattern as anti-B mesons. This, called charge-parity (CP) violation, had long been sought before KEK B-Factory's most notable discovery to date. The experimental confirmation that the Kobayashi-Maskawa's CP violation theory is indeed real in B and K mesons.",
