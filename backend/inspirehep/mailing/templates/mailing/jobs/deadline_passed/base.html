Dear {{ recipient }},
<p>
  The INSPIRE Jobs listing for your position: <a href="https://{{ host }}/jobs/{{ job.control_number}}">{{ host }}/jobs/{{ job.control_number }}</a> has an expired deadline: {{ job.deadline_date }}.<br/>
  The job posting will no longer be available in the search results after that date. If you wish to open the job posting again, please modify the deadline date or change the job status to Open through the form:<br /><a href="https://{{ host }}/submissions/jobs/{{ job.control_number }}">{{host}}/submissions/jobs/{{job.control_number}}</a>.
</p>
<p>Note that you will not be able to re-open jobs that have been closed for more than 30 days. Closed jobs are no longer visible in the search results.</p>
<p>
  You can find more information on how to update and close a job posting in our <a href="https://labs.inspirehep.net/help/knowledge-base/submitting-updating-and-removing-a-job-on-inspire/">blog</a>.<br />
  The INSPIRE Jobs database receives thousands of hits a day from people in the high energy physics community. Our goal is to make it useful and efficient for people both advertising and seeking positions. We therefore wish to keep our listings as current as possible.<br />
  Your assistance is greatly appreciated.

Best Wishes,<br />
