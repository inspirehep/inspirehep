class SearchCheckDo(ABC):
    """Find and modify programmatically a number of records based on some criteria.

    This is an abstract base class that needs to be subclassed to provide the
    concrete implementations of the different steps to perform.

    The following data need to be provided:
    * ``query``: The search query string to select the records to operate on.
    * ``check``: A method accepting an ``InspireRecord`` instance (or rather, a
    collection-specific subclass of it) and returning True iff that record
    needs to be modified. It must also accept a ``logger`` kwarg that can be
    used to perform additional (structured) logging, and a ``state`` kwarg,
    which is a dict that can be used to preserve some (expensive or annoying to
    compute) state for the ``do`` step of the current record.
    * ``do``: A method accepting a record (satisfying the check) and mutating
    it in place. It must also accept a ``logger`` kwarg that can be used to
    perform additional (structured) logging, and a ``state`` kwarg which is a
    dict containing state preserved by the ``check`` step of the current record.

    By default, the search will be done for Literature records. If a different
    search is required, ``search_class`` needs to be set to a different search
    class (see ``inspirehep.search.api``).

    In order to speed things up, this can be run in parallel as an IndexedJob
    on kubernetes. In addition to the automatically created
    ``JOB_COMPLETION_INDEX`` environment variable, the ``JOB_COMPLETIONS`` env
    var needs to be set to ``.spec.completions``. Work will then be automatically
    distributed between the different pods of the job.

    Instantiating the class will run it.
