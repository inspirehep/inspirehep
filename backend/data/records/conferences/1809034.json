It was initiated in early 90ies by the Bogolyubov Institute for Theoretical Physics of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, in close collaboration with the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (Dubna). The conferences are dedicated, in a balanced way, to recent experimental data and new theoretical ideas, offering wide space for discussions. Previous conferences were held at various places, including the Crimea, Natal, Montenegro and Odessa). They bring together about 90 participants from all over the world, East and West, theorists and experimentalists, young and mature. Talks of experts, by invitation should be understandable for the wide audience including students. Young researchers and students have the opportunity to introduce themselves at a special students' session. The contributions will be published shortly after the conference in the peer-reviewed Ukrainian Journal of Physics.       </div>"
