    ETHNICITY_DATA_PATH: Location of ethnicity data required for EthnicityEstimator
        training.

    ETHNICITY_MODEL_PATH: Location of dumped ethnicity model.

    DISTANCE_MODEL_PATH: Location of dumped distance model.

    CLUSTERING_N_JOBS: Number of processes to use for clustering.

    DISPLAY_PROGRESS: When True displays progress bar during pairing process.

    LOG_LEVEL: Minimum log level which will be displaying messages.

    REDIS_PHONETIC_BLOCK_KEY: Key in redis from which script will read signature blocks
        to re-cluster.

    REDIS_URL: full redis url.

    REDIS_TIMEOUT: Redis timeout.

    SAMPLED_PAIRS_SIZE: The number of signature pairs we sample during training.

        Since INSPIRE has ~3M curated signatures it would take too much time
        to train on all possible pairs, so we sample ~1M pairs in such a way
        that they are representative of the known clusters structure.

        Note:

            It MUST be a multiple of 12 for the reason explained in
            :mod:`inspirehep.modules.disambiguation.core.ml.sampling`.

    ES_HOSTNAME: hostname and port of elasticsearch.

    ES_TIMEOUT: Timeout set for redis connection.

    ES_MAX_QUERY_SIZE: Maximum size for one page of results from ES.
        Note:
             By default ES allows to get 10000 results at one page at once.

    INSPIREHEP_DISAMBIGUATION_URL: Inspirehep url where we post clustering results.

    INSPIREHEP_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN: Authentication token used to access
        inspirehep endpoints.
