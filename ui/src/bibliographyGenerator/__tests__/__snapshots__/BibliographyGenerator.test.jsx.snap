\\maketitle

This paper is pretty eclectic, since it cites a buch of diverse
  things.  Of course, since it has no content, that is perhaps not so
  difficult.

Primarily I want to refer the reader to Brodsky and Wu's recent work on the renormalization 
group\\cite{Brodsky:2012ms}, which is relatively unrelated to the recent
work by Beacom, Bell, and Dodelson \\cite{Beacom:2004yd}.  I should also point out that
the paper by Kreitz and Brooks \\cite{physics/0309027} is being cited here in a
purely self-serving manner.  

There are many papers by Dixon and others that I'd like to point out here
\\cite{hep-th/0501240,hep-th/0412210,JHEP.0412.015}. 
In particular I wish to point out that the work done in
\\cite{JHEP.0412.015} is irrelevant to this paper.  

There are some items in the paper \\cite{Akimov:2012vv} which I would like
to draw your attention to, but it is likely that as above, I may be citing
this for the wrong reasons.


I had better cite the most recent Review of Particle Properties
\\cite{Nakamura:2010zzi}, since that
gets quite a lot of cites, while citing a few papers about stringy topics
\\cite{hep-th/9711200} is also worthwhile.  No paper is complete without a cite to
some extra-dimensional papers like \\cite{hep-ph/9803315,hep-ph/9905221}.
Finally, let me make a mistake citing this paper \\cite{hep-scifi/0101001}.

                    <p>
                      Write your paper in LaTeX as usual. Cite papers in your LaTeX file in the following way:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>
                        INSPIRE Texkeys, e.g. \\cite{Beacom:2010kk}
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Eprint numbers, e.g. \\cite{1004.3311} or \\cite{hep-th/9711200}
                      </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                      You can then upload your LaTeX file here to generate a list of the references in the order they are cited in your paper. The system will understand cite fields with multiple papers such as \\cite{Beacom:2010kk, hep-th/9711200}. Note that if you combine multiple papers under a single texkey only the one belonging to the texkey will show up, the others will not.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      You have several options for the bibkey:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>
                        hep-th/0001001 or any eprint number
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        PhysRev.D66.010001 or any journal reference using typical abbreviations for the journal name (note no periods in the journal name)
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Hagiwara:2002fs or any INSPIRE LaTeX key for the paper
                      </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                      You may also want to remember the following tips when citing papers:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>
                        You can combine multiple references in one \\cite command, again using commas to separate the references. Example: \\cite{Hagiwara:2002fs,hep-ex/0101001,PhysRev.D13.1}. These will be cited separately in your bibliography.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The reference will always appear in the same format regardless of how you cite it so if you have a choice, use the eprint number as the identifier rather than a journal publication note.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Do not worry about whether you have cited something before, INSPIRE will get the order right based on when you cited the references in the paper.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The only allowed characters in \\cite commands are letters, numbers and the following signs: "-", "/", ":", "," and ".". If your alias or bibkey contains something else, it will not be processed.
                      </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                      Output format: You can select "LaTeX (EU)" to create references in the European style (year before page). If you'd like the output in BiBTeX format, suitable for adding to your .bib file try generate bibtex, but beware that aliases to multiple articles (i.e., a nickname for many papers, cited as one) don't really work, since the .bib file expects separate entries for each paper. Note that this will generate BiBTeX output for the citations in you paper. You can't send a .bib file and get results this way.
