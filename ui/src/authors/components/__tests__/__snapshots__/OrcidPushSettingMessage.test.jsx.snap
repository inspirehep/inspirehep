     yet. Please note that only the publications that are verified as yours on INSPIRE will be exported to ORCID.

    To export your publications to ORCID, please follow the following instructions:

        <p>
          Clean your INSPIRE profile
        </p>
        <p>
          Before you export your publications to ORCID, you must clean up and prepare your INSPIRE author profile. The goal is to have a unique INSPIRE profile associated to you, with all works marked as yours.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most expedient way to clean your profile is to obtain an arXiv ID and login to INSPIRE using this arXiv ID. If you don’t use an arXiv ID, you can make changes to your profile as a guest, but all actions will require approval from the INSPIRE team, which may take a few days depending on how many requests are before yours. If you don’t mind waiting, you can follow the instructions below without signing in with an arXiv ID and still prepare your author profile for an ORCID connection. Please be aware that this approval process is necessary to ensure the quality of the information we have in INSPIRE.

    Note that if you use your ORCID when publishing a paper, INSPIRE will automatically attribute it to you and send this information to the ORCID register. If you don’t, or if the publisher doesn’t send this information to INSPIRE, you need to claim it.
